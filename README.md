# Multi-Class-Obesity-Risk
 This project develops a machine learning model to predict multi-class obesity risk levels based on various lifestyle and physiological factors. Using the XGBoost algorithm, the model achieves a high accuracy in distinguishing obesity risk levels, helping to identify at-risk individuals for early interventions.
